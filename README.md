## Why the move?

The project has been renamed to better reflect its purpose and improve discoverability:
- **Old name**: `claude-goblin-mod` (fork-focused naming)
- **New name**: `claude-code-usage-analytics` (feature-focused naming)

All features, history, and tags have been migrated to the new repository.
